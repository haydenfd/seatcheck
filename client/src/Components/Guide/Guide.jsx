        To get your course tracking set up, navigate to the course page on
        MyUCLA, copy the link, and paste it into the course tracking URL. Make
        sure to put in an email to have the website notify you when a spot in
        the class/waitlist opens up. We are currently working on integrating a
        feature that let's you choose the course from a dropdown directly,
        without having you manually fetch the link from MyUCLA.
